# Training Experiences

The training of *SELF-ALIGN* method involves four distinct stages. The first stage is called **Topic-Guided Red-Teaming Self-Instruct**, which employs the language model itself to generate synthetic instructions and enhance diversity via a topic-guided red-teaming approach. The second stage, **Principle-Driven Self-Alignment**, establishes a set of principles that the AI model must adhere to and provides in-context learning demonstrations for constructing helpful, ethical, and reliable responses. The third stage, **Principle Engraving**, fine-tunes the base language model by pruning principles and demonstrations, empowering the model to directly generate appropriate responses. Finally, the fourth stage, **Verbose Cloning**, serves as a complementary step to address challenges arising from overly-brief or indirect responses by refining the model to produce detailed and comprehensive answers to user queries. We will describe each of these stages in detail.
